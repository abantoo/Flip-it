      <h2>
        The company is based on a concept of using recycled, used PC (personal
        computer) parts to create a complete PC set up making it sustainable and
        affordable for everyone who wants to buy it. This is an era of
        technology, and PCs are used more or less for a lot of purposes
        (business, education, entertainment) making it the right time to enter
        the market. A lot of people want to buy a PC but can’t afford one since
        they are expensive. Our company makes various categories of PCs
        according to customer needs and it is affordable since it is 30%-40%
        cheaper compared to a new PC since our products are recycled and the
        warranty of 1 year provided by our company makes sure that the customers
        don’t suffer from buyer’s guilt. This warranty is not given by any used
        PC sellers and we hope this will help build customer trust with our new
        venture. Customer service is our priority and we have a team for
        dedicated customer support at any time.
